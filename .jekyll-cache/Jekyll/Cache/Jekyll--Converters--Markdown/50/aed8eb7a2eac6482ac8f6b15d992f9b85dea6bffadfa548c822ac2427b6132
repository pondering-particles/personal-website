<p>Hi!! This is Pratyush, a PhD student at Stony Brook University under the benign tutelage of <a href="https://jorge-a-mendez.github.io/">Jorge Mendez-Mendez</a> working on Robotics and ML/Agents for Science. I work on problems that are based in TAMP while drawing ideas from AI/ML, Deep Learning, Foundation models, Logic to build techniques and systems that can enable robots to comprehend and reason over the geometric nature of our world while efficiently dealing with the combinatorial explosion that this entails. Parallely, I am working towards building agentic systems that act as automated scientists, equipped with an array of foundational tools, capable of systematically tackling a non-trivial scientific problem. Prior to this, I was a Mathematics+Computer Science undergrad at Ashoka University, where I was advised by <a href="https://debayangupta.com/">Debayan Gupta</a>.</p>

<p>In not too distant past, I was PhD student focused on Quantum Computing and my other deep interests lie broadly in the area of quantum many body physics where I am interested in studying methods like tensor networks, quantum MCMC, electronic structure theory etc.</p>

<p>Outside academic pursuits, I enjoy standup comedy, cooking, power lifting, sketching, watching lots and lots of films across all genres, languages and eras. In the distant future, I intend to learn to use the synthesizer and make films.</p>
